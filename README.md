Hanna Code Helper
=================

This module is intended as a helper for Hanna Code textformatter by Ryan Cramer. It provides a way to select existing Hanna Code tags within the editor.

This module uses Teppo's HannaCodeHelper as a starting point. That module can be found here: https://github.com/teppokoivula/HannaCodeHelper

Some of the code is duplicated from Ryan's original module and this module also requires both TextformatterHannaCode and ProcessHannaCode modules installed. You can get those from https://github.com/ryancramerdesign/ProcessHannaCode.
